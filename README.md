## OpenSearch Catalog

_For deeper dive into the catalog repository - please check our [main catalog documentation page ](docs/README.md)_

The OpenSearch Catalog is designed to make it easier for developers and community to contribute, search and install artifacts like:
 
### Integrations
 - [Integrations](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/integrations/)
 - [Integrations Readme](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-catalog/blob/main/docs/integrations/README.md)
 - [Integration Observability Catalog](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-catalog/blob/main/integrations/observability/catalog.html)

The Integration catalog is a concept that focuses on grouping similar integration together to allow a meaningful way of introducing a common group into the user's working space.


### Visualization
- [Visualizations](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/visualization/)
- [Visualizations Readme](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-catalog/blob/main/docs/visualization/README.md)

The Visualization Catalog is a central repository for organizing and sharing visualizations used in integrations developed using the standard simple schema mapping ( structure aware visual components).
This catalog aims to extend the usage of different data-visualization component for the benefit of delivering fast, configurable and context aware user experience.
