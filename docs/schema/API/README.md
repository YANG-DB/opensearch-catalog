# Schema API

Version: 1.0.0

This is the Schema Catalog API

# API elements

The catalog/schema API exposes the capability to express the domain entities structure.
Domain entities are a logical representation of the underlying index mapping that reflects the actual physical
structure.
As detailed in the [README](../README.md) document, the catalog (schema) is a unification of entities that share a
domain contextual relationship.

For Observability - the domain is composed out of 3 distinct entities (pronounced signals in the open telemetry
terminology)

- Traces
- Logs
- Metrics

Each one represents a sub-graph of components (entities) which relate to one another in a specific manner.

The following API will allow to query and understand:

- the graph hierarchy within the schema
- the attribute dictionary for each entity
- the actual instances physically created from the schema templates

## Schema

The `/schema` endpoint will return all the domain specific catalogs stored within the cluster.
The `/schema/{id}` endpoint will return a specific domain catalog stored within the cluster.

### Schema Structure

The schema structure contains both the compositional classes that are part of the specific schema (categories,
components, fields)
For additional information see [README](../README.md)

**Examples**

- The [catalogs schema](../system/catalog.schema)
- The [catalogs instance example](../system/samples/catalog.json)

## Dictionary

The `/schema/{id}/dictionary` endpoint will return a specific domain catalog dictionary of fields and attributes
encapsulated within this schema

It's also possible to filter the dictionary according to any of the following categories:

- category : `GET /schema/Observability/dictionary?category=logs`
- component: `GET /schema/Observability/dictionary?component=http`
- name: `GET /schema/Observability/dictionary?field=response*`
- mixture:  `GET /schema/Observability/dictionary?category=traces&component=services`

**Examples**

- The [dictionary schema](../system/dictionary.schema)
- The [dictionary instance example](../system/samples/dictionary.json)

## Instances

The `/schema/{id}/instances` endpoint will return a specific domain list of instances which include all the domain's
components that have been created using the schema's templates

- Indices (created using index mapping templates)
- DataStreams (created using index mapping templates)
- DataSource (created and associated with mapping templates)

It's also possible to filter the instances according to any of the following categories:

- category : `GET /schema/Observability/instances?category=logs`
- component: `GET /schema/Observability/instances?component=http`
- name: `GET /schema/Observability/instances?field=response*`
- mixture:  `GET /schema/Observability/instances?category=traces&component=services`

**Examples**

- The [instances schema](../system/instances.schema)
- The [instances example](../system/samples/instances.json)

_This concept was inspired from the [OCSF](https://schema.ocsf.io/) schema model
and [swagger](https://schema.ocsf.io/doc/index.html#/)_

## API Mock Tests

The [Swagger](swagger.yaml) describes the API used by the Integration repository to support the `catalog`, `registry`
and `store` functionalities.

Its possible to visualize the REST API using any on the numerous [online editors](https://editor.swagger.io/)

### Setup mock server

In order to test the API, we can utilize a swagger based mock library which
allows ['contract based testing'](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism).

#### running the swagger mock server

````
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
````

Once this tool is installed, the server can be run using the next command

```
prism mock swagger.yaml
```

The next endpoints are presented:

```
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/schema?limit=41
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      POST       http://127.0.0.1:4010/schema
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/schema/sed
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/repository?limit=%5Bobject%20Object%5D
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      POST       http://127.0.0.1:4010/repository
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/repository/%5Bobject%20Object%5D
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/store?limit=25
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      POST       http://127.0.0.1:4010/store
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      GET        http://127.0.0.1:4010/store/cum
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      POST       http://127.0.0.1:4010/store/nihil/validate
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      POST       http://127.0.0.1:4010/store/laudantium/upload
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ℹ  info      PUT        http://127.0.0.1:4010/store/nihil/activate
[10:32:12 a.m.] › [CLI] ▶  start     Prism is listening on http://127.0.0.1:4010
```

Once the server has started, a CURL request can be initiated with any of the above endpoints:

`GET http://localhost:4010/schema`

Would show in the traffic logs:

`[10:32:23 a.m.] › [HTTP SERVER] get /schema ℹ  info      Request received`

And will result with :

      ]

  ]
}
```

#### running the swagger mock server as docker

One-liner docker command (assuming running from repository root):

```text
docker run -p 9200:4010 -v "$(pwd)/docs/API:/api" -v "$(pwd)/schema:/schema" --name integ-prism -t stoplight/prism mock -h 0.0.0.0 /api/swagger.yaml
```
